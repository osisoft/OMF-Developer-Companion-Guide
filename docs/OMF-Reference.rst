OMF reference information
=========================

The OMF specification (located `here <http://omf-docs.osisoft.com/en/v1.0/>`_) is generic in that it does not specify a particular back-end system. 

This topic is a companion to the OMF specification which describes how OMF is interpreted by PI Server back-end system. 

Size Limits and Special Characters 
----------------------------------

The maximum size of OMF message content is 192Kb. 

The OMF application Name and Type (which are specified when registering your instance with PI Data Collection Manager),
should be fewer than 255 characters in length, and should not contain any control characters or any of the characters from
the following list:

::

  *'?;{}[]|`"\ 
 

All OMF JSON identities should be less than 255 characters in length, and should not contain any control characters 
from the following list: 

::

  *'?;{}[]|`"\ 

Note that it is not possible to specify the maximum length of several names or identities at once (similar to the PI 
Server back-end which are presented as concatenations of each other). For example, if a PI AF Element Template name 
consists of the following parts: 

OMF.{*OMF application type*} 
Connector.{*OMF type definition identifier* | *OMF type definition name*}. 

The Maximum length of template names should be less than 260 characters (see *PI AF SDK Reference*). 
Therefore, you must calculate character lengths for both OMF application type, and OMF type definition ID and name. 

As a rule of thumb, keep the sizes of all names and identifies to 50 â€“ 60 characters at most (although even these sizes 
might result in your application being difficult to read and understand.)

Note: PI Data Archive does not support Unicode. Therefore, all data that gets created in PI Data Archive must 
be formatted as ASCII in addition to the requirement that it contain no control character. For example, if a 
tag is named as follows, both ``producertoken`` and ``measurement`` must be formatted in ASCII; Unicode is not 
accepted (that is, no Japanese, Chinese, and so on):

``{producertoken}.{measurement name}``



Message Headers
---------------

A description of each of the headers can be found in the *OMF specification*. When sending messages to PI Server, the value 
of the ``producertoken`` header must be set to a Producer Token that is obtained from the PI Data Collection Manager. 

The Producer Token is used to authenticate the sender and to authorize the sender to feed data to PI Connector 
Relay ingress endpoint. 
 
 
HTTP Response and Error Codes 
-----------------------------

The following status codes are returned by PI Connector Relay accepting OMF messages over HTTP. 
 

+---------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Status code         | Description                                                                                            |
+=====================+========================================================================================================+
| 204 No Content      | OMF message was successfully processed. Response message does not have any content.                    |
+---------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 400 Bad request     | The OMF message was malformed or not understood. The client should not retry sending the message       |
|                     | without modifications.                                                                                 |
+---------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 401 Unauthorized    | Authentication failed. Provided Producer Token was not recognized. Your OMF application instance is    |
|                     | not registered with PI Data Collection Manager.                                                        |
+---------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 403 Forbidden       | Authentication succeeded, but not authorized. Indicates that either the Producer Token expiration date |
|                     | has been reached (error code 2) or that the Producer Token has been revoked (error code 3).            |
+---------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 413 Payload Too     | Payload size exceeds OMF body size limit. Maximum size of either compressed or uncompressed data       |
| large               | should not exceed 192Kb.                                                                               |
+---------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 500 Internal Server | The server encountered an unexpected condition. Errors can be found in the Windows Event Viewer on the |
| error               | machine running PI Connector Relay.                                                                    |
